## üîß Technical Implementation

### Multi-File Upload Component

```python
class MultiFileUploadComponent:
    """Professional multi-file upload component for bid generation"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_file_size = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB
        self.allowed_extensions = ['.pdf']
        self.required_categories = [FileCategory.SPECIFICATIONS]
        self.recommended_categories = [FileCategory.BID_FORMS, FileCategory.CONSTRUCTION_PLANS]
```

### File Categories and Styling

Each file category has:
- Unique icon and color scheme
- Clear description and example filename
- Required/recommended/optional designation
- Professional styling with gradients

### Analysis Workflow

1. **File Upload**: Users upload files to categorized sections
